## OVERVIEW
As a market maker, having a global price index is essential.
To do that, we are using orderbook data provided by exchanges and computing them to have a fair mid-price (the average between best bid and best ask.)


### GOALS
Expose a REST API which gives us the global price index of the trading pair BTC/USDT, computed from 3 different exchanges :

1. Binance
2. Kraken
3. Huobi

### SPECIFICATIONS
Your mission, if you accept it, will be to fetch the BTC/USDT order book from the 3 exchanges written above; compute for each orderbook a mid-price and finally return an average of these mid-prices. You have to take into consideration that you may add new exchanges later.

### DOCUMENTATIONS
- Binance api documentation:

- Huobi api documentation:

## TECHNOLOGY STACK
- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- Express.JS

## ADDED EXTRAS
- Extended beyond BTC/USDT to any trading pair that exists, e.g LTC/USDT, ETH/USDT
- Included Mid Price from every exchange consulted in api response
- Included health endpoint for uptime monitoring
- Added Dockerfile for easier deployment 

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Monitoring of rest API calls to avoid rate limiting
- Addition of more centralized exchanges and their apis
- Integration of decentralized exchanges / smartcontracts

## HOW IT WORKS
To use the application execute the following commands via curl, postman or a simple browser page.

1. Sample Response
```
{
  "price": 105982.38,
  "pair": "BTCUSDT",
  "exchanges": {
    "binance": 105999.535,
    "kraken": 105998.25,
    "huobi": 105949.355
  }
}
```

2. URL of application: 
```
http://localhost:3000/price/BTCUSDT
```

3. To use curl:
```
curl "http://localhost:3000/price/BTCUSDT"
```

4. To add and check price of a new tradingpair:
```
curl "http://localhost:3000/price/ETHUSDT"
```
